## Timing of Data Analysis

* When is the best time to think about data analysis?
* So far: 
    + Dataset is given
    + Analysis comes after data collection
    + Structure of data cannot be changed
* Better: 
    + Plan data analysis before data collection
    + Experimental design
    + Use simulation ...
    
    
## Simulation

* What is simulation? 
* Given there is an effect between characteristics of variables
* Generate data that contains the effects
* Re-analyse generated data
* Can effects be found?


## Examples

* `Body Weight` on `Breast Circumference` 
* Differences between feeds ...
* Differences between treatment and controls ...
* Differences betwween healthy and diseased ...
