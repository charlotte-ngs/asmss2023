# Disclaimer
The required steps to start a new course project are always the same. In what follows the required steps as they are remembered, are documented.


# Course Creation
It starts with a simple RStudio project by 

```bash
CRSPAR=/Users/pvr/Data/Projects/Github/charlotte-ngs/asmss2023_gh-root/main
mkdir -p $CRSPAR
cd $CRSPAR
CRSNAME=asmss2023
qrspm create $CRSNAME
cd $CRSNAME
```

Inside RStudio, the following commands are executed

```r
usethis::use_vignette(name = "course_additional_material", title = "Additional Material")
usethis::use_vignette(name = "course_exercises", title = "Exercises")
usethis::use_vignette(name = "course_notes", title = "Course Notes")
usethis::use_vignette(name = "course_solutions", title = "Solutions")
usethis::use_version()
```

A YAML file for `pkgdown` is created based on older versions. Finally the first version of the website is created

```r
pkgdown::build_site()
```


# Course Notes
Copy older version of course notes

```bash
CRSDIR=/Users/pvr/Data/Projects/Github/charlotte-ngs/asmss2023_gh-root/main/asmss2023
mkdir -p cn
cd $CRSDIR/cn
for f in 01_intro.Rmd _bookdown.yml _output.yml bibliography.bib index.Rmd preamble.tex
do
  echo " * Copy $f ..."
  cp ../../../../asmss2022_gh-root/main/asmss2022/cn/$f .
  sleep 2
done
# copy diagram dir
cp -r ../../../../asmss2022_gh-root/main/asmss2022/cn/odg .
```
